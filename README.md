Artificial Intelligence and the Rise of the Humans: Slides and Links
[The Slides](https://github.com/BBhacKing/BSidesFtWayne/blob/main/0900-BBKing-AI-Rise-of-Humans-6.pdf)

# TL;DR

A.I. is here, and it's not going away.

But you were here first, and you're actually intelligent.

A.I. is a tool. An amazing tool, but just a tool. Look for ways it can help you do your job better. You've been here before.

It's not going to replace you. But you can't ignore it, either.
